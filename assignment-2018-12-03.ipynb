You can find the schema for the data set [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lapets/course-data-science/master/assignment-2018-12-03-schema.txt). The data is stored in a tab-separated value file in which each line represents an individual person. The data set was extracted from the 1994 US census data. Your goal is to evaluate different models for determining whether a person has an annual salary that is $50,000 or above.  "

Thus, it is necessary to create a new feature dimension for every unique value of each categorical variable. To accomplish this, you can use `pandas.get_dummies`. An example is provided below."
